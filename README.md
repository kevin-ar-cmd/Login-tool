    *   The `README.md` file uses Markdown syntax. Here's a basic example of what you could include:

    ```markdown
    # Termux Login Enforcement

    This project enforces password-based login for Termux sessions, adding a layer of security to prevent unauthorized access.

    ## Features

    *   Password-protected login
    *   Login lockout after multiple failed attempts
    *   Secure password storage using hashing and salting

    ## Prerequisites

    *   Termux (installed on an Android device)
    *   `openssl` (install with `pkg install openssl`)

    ## Installation

    1.  Clone the repository:
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/kevin-ar-cmd/Login-tool.git
       ```
    2.  Run the setup script:
       ```bash
       ~/.termux_login/setup_credentials.sh
       ```
       This will prompt you to create a new password.
    3.  Add the following lines to the *beginning* of your `~/.bashrc` file:
       ```bash
       if [ -z "$TERMUX_GUI_STARTED" ]; then
         ~/.termux_login/login.sh
       fi
       ```

    ## Configuration

    The following configuration variables can be adjusted in the `login.sh` script:

    *   `MAX_ATTEMPTS`: Maximum number of failed login attempts allowed.
    *   `LOCKOUT_DURATION`: Lockout duration in seconds.

    ## Security Considerations

    *   The `.login_credentials` file stores the hashed password and salt. Ensure this file has appropriate permissions (`chmod 600 .login_credentials`).
    *   The `.login_lockout` and `.failed_attempts` files are used to track lockout state and failed attempts.

    *   **Customize the content:**  Replace `<your_repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.  Add more details about your project, how to use it, and any specific instructions.  Choose a license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL) and add a `LICENSE` file to your repository as well.
    *   **Markdown Syntax:** Use Markdown to format your `README.md` file.  Headers start with `#`, lists use `*` or `1.`, and code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks (`````).

3.  **Add the `README.md` file to Git:**

    ```bash
    git add README.md
    ```

4.  **Commit the changes:**

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add README.md file"
    ```

5.  **Push to GitHub:**

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

**Best Practices for a Good `README.md`**

*   **Project Title:** Start with a clear and descriptive title.
*   **Description:** Briefly explain what the project does and its purpose.
*   **Features:** List the key features of your project.
*   **Prerequisites:** Specify any software or libraries that are required to use the project.
*   **Installation Instructions:** Provide clear and step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the project.
*   **Usage Instructions:** Explain how to use the project, including examples and code snippets.
*   **Configuration:** Describe any configuration options that are available.
*   **Security Considerations:** If your project involves security, outline any important security considerations.
*   **Contributing:** Explain how others can contribute to the project.
*   **License:** Specify the license under which the project is released.
*   **Contact Information:** Provide a way for people to contact you with questions or feedback.

**Example `README.md` for Your Termux Login Project**

Here's a more complete `README.md` tailored to your Termux login project:

```markdown
# Termux Login Enforcement

This project enforces password-based login for Termux sessions, adding a layer of security to prevent unauthorized access to your Termux environment.  It provides a simple login prompt and lockout mechanism to protect against unauthorized use.

## Features

*   **Password-Protected Login:** Requires a password to start a Termux session.
*   **Login Lockout:** Temporarily locks the account after a configurable number of failed login attempts.
*   **Secure Password Storage:** Uses hashing and salting to protect the stored password.
*   **Easy Installation:** Simple setup process.
*   **Configurable:**  Adjustable lockout duration and maximum attempts.

## Prerequisites

*   Termux (installed on an Android device)
*   `openssl` (install with `pkg install openssl`)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kevin-ar-cmd/Login-tool.git
   
   termux_login

2.  **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   ~/.termux_login/setup_credentials.sh
   ```
   This script will prompt you to create a new password.  It will store the hashed password and salt in the `~/.termux_login/.login_credentials` file.

3.  **Integrate with `.bashrc`:**
   Add the following lines to the *beginning* of your `~/.bashrc` file:

   ```bash
   if [ -z "$TERMUX_GUI_STARTED" ]; then
     ~/.termux_login/login.sh
   fi
   ```
   This will execute the `login.sh` script whenever a new Termux session is started (unless a GUI has already started).

## Configuration

The following configuration variables can be adjusted in the `~/.termux_login/login.sh` script:

*   `MAX_ATTEMPTS`: The maximum number of failed login attempts allowed before the account is locked out (default: 3).
*   `LOCKOUT_DURATION`: The duration (in seconds) for which the account will be locked out after exceeding the maximum number of failed attempts (default: 60).

You can edit these variables directly in the `login.sh` file using a text editor like `nano`.

## Security Considerations

*   **File Permissions:** Ensure that the `~/.termux_login/.login_credentials`, `~/.termux_login/.login_lockout`, and `~/.termux_login/.failed_attempts` files have appropriate permissions ( `chmod 600` ). This prevents other users on the system from accessing these sensitive files.
*   **Lockout Duration:** Choose a reasonable lockout duration. Too short, and it won't be effective against brute-force attacks. Too long, and it will be frustrating for legitimate users.
*   **Attack Surface:** Be aware that an attacker could potentially try to delete the `~/.termux_login/.login_lockout` or `~/.termux_login/.failed_attempts` files to bypass the lockout mechanism. Restricting permissions on these files is crucial.
*   **Disclaimer:** This script is provided for educational purposes only and should not be used in a production environment without thorough security review and hardening. Always prioritize security best practices. Using this script is at your own risk.
